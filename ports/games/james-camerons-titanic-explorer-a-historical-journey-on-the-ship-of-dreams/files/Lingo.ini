  global gQT3WinSndMix
  -- This global specifies if QuickTime and regular audio streams can be mixed together
  -- and played at the same time.  The default is no mixing; 'click' sounds and other
  -- sound effects do not play when QuickTime movies are already playing.
  -- Before enabling this value, you MUST also have up-to-date Intel RSX or DirectX
  -- (aka DirectSound) sound drivers installed on your PC.  You can get current
  -- RSX drivers from:  http://www.intel.com/ial/rsx/
  -- Follow the installation directions carefully.
  --
  -- -- following line overrides Windows' default and enables QuickTime sound mixing,
  -- -- /when appropriate Intel RSX or DirectSound drivers are correctly installed/
  -- -- (and 'QT3Mix.dll' remains enabled in 'Titanic.ini')
set gQT3WinSndMix = TRUE

  global gQT3AllowDirectToScreen
  -- This global explicitly enables direct-to-screen video playback, which will
  -- greatly improve the performance of QuickTime and QuickTime VR movies.
  -- Normally, you should leave the following lines commented out and Titanic Explorer
  -- will determine proper settings on startup, enabling direct-to-screen video whenever
  -- possible.  The exception is:
  -- > full-screen playback of Titanic Explorer (the originally installed file 'Titanic.exe'),
  -- > Windows 95 or 98 (not NT),
  -- > and ONLY when running in 8-bit color (256 colors) mode (higher color depth are fine).
  --
  -- If you specifically have the above configuration, by default, Titanic Explorer will
  -- disable direct-to-screen video.  This ensures that the video colors display correctly,
  -- at the expense of reduced playback performance.
  -- In this case, to improve performance, try one of the following:
  --  1. See if you can adjust your monitor's settings to display at higher color depths
  --     (Start -> Settings -> Control Panel => Display => Settings -> Color Palette).
  --     This is the easiest solution and will greatly improve Titanic Explorer's appearance
  --     and performance.  Note that you may be able to display more colors by first
  --     setting a smaller desktop area (down to a minimum of 640x480).  Setting a smaller
  --     desktop area will also allow Titanic Explorer to fill your display.
  --     [NOTE: In this case, you do /not/ need to change this file.]
  -- or,
  --
  --  2. If you must run Windows 95 or 98 in 8-bit color mode, use the special 'in-a-window'
  --     version of Titanic Explorer included on CD-ROM Volume 1.  This version allows
  --     fast direct-to-screen video but does not 'black-out' your desktop (so
  --     your desktop may appear to display in 'wrong' colors while Titanic Explorer
  --     is running).
  --     To install the special 'in-a-window' version of Titanic Explorer:
  --      a. you MUST have the 'standard' version of Titanic Explorer already installed
  --           on your hard drive.
  --      b. from Windows, locate and open the 'Titanic Explorer' folder you originally
  --           installed on your hard drive.
  --      c. insert Titanic Explorer CD-ROM Volume 1 in your CD-ROM drive, and:
  --         * open the CD-ROM's icon,
  --         * locate and open the folder 'Titanic8'.  then,
  --      d. select all the items inside the 'Titanic8' folder and copy them into
  --           the 'Titanic Explorer' folder on your hard drive.  (If necessary, click OK to
  --           replace any old versions of the files.)
  --        (for more information on accessing and copying files, please refer to the manuals
  --        that came with your computer)
  --      To run the modified program, open the 'Titanic Explorer' folder where you just
  --      copied the files, and double-click the application (.exe file) labelled 'Titanic8'.
  --      (note that the original shortcut installed in your Start menu will /not/
  --      automatically run the 'in-a-window' version, you MUST explicitly double-click
  --      the 'Titanic8' application icon.)
  --      [NOTE: In this case, you do /not/ need to change this file.]
  -- or,
  --
  --  3. If necessary (or directed by tech support), you can override the default settings and
  --     initialize the gQT3AllowDirectToScreen flag in this startup file.  Do this by
  --     uncommenting one of the the following lines, saving and closing this file, and
  --     then starting the 'Titanic' application.
  --
  -- -- following line overrides defaults and /always/ allows direct-to-screen video.
  -- -- performance will improve over non- direct-to-screen but colors may appear incorrectly
  -- -- for the configurations identified above
  --set gQT3AllowDirectToScreen = TRUE
  --
  -- -- OR:
  -- -- following line overrides defaults and /never/ allows direct-to-screen video.
  -- -- colors will appear correctly but at the expense of playback performance
  -- -- (in this case, you should also set 'reduced' video size from within Titanic
  -- -- Explorer itself, either on the main menu or in Global Controls).
  --set gQT3AllowDirectToScreen = FALSE
  --
  --/bak



  global gCDDeviceControl
  -- This global specifies a preferred method for Titanic Explorer to use
  -- in controlling your computer's CD-ROM drive.  The default is to use the
  -- Enhanced CD Control DLL (eCDCtrl.dll) for Windows 95 and 98, and standard
  -- Windows Media Control Interface (MCI) calls for Windows NT.
  --
  -- -- following line overrides defaults and /always/ tries to use the eCDCtrl DLL:
  --set gCDDeviceControl = "eCdCtrl"
  --
  -- -- OR:
  -- -- following line overrides defaults and /always/ tries to use MCI:
  --set gCDDeviceControl = "mci"
  --
  --/bak



  global gWinDissolveStyle
  -- This global specifies a preferred method for dissolve transitions under Windows.
  -- The default is a boxy square style, which is a chunkier dissolve but more compatible
  -- with older video cards.  The alternative is a pattern dissolve, which is more
  -- aesthetically pleasing but can result in very slow performance on some video cards.
  --
  -- -- following line is equivalent to defaults and forces a blocky square dissolve:
  --set gWinDissolveStyle = "dissolveBoxySquares"
  --
  -- -- OR:
  -- -- following line overrides defaults and uses the pattern dissolve style:
  --set gWinDissolveStyle = "dissolvePatterns"
  --
  --/bak



  global gWinAllowVRO
  -- Allow display of QTVR Objects within Titanic Explorer (may cause crashes)
  -- Default = FALSE
  -- -- following line overrides defaults and tries to display QTVR Objects:
  --set gWinAllowVRO = TRUE
  --
  --/bak
